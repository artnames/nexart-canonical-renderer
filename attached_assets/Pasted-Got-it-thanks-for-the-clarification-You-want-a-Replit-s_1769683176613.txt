Got it — thanks for the clarification 👍
You want a Replit-style engineering prompt that tells the agent exactly what to update in the repo (README, docs, examples) after the lenient protocolVersion defaulting change.

Below is a clean, copy-pasteable Replit prompt written the way Replit agents actually work best: scoped, explicit, non-hand-wavy, and aligned with how you’ve built NexArt.

✅ Replit Prompt — Update Public Docs After Lenient protocolVersion Change

Context
The NexArt Canonical Renderer has been updated to support lenient defaulting of protocolVersion when omitted.

Behavior is now:
	•	protocolVersion optional
	•	If omitted → defaults to current canonical version
	•	If provided → must match a supported version or request fails
	•	Response always includes resolved version in headers
	•	Defaulted executions are explicitly marked and logged

The implementation is already done in code.
Your task is documentation-only: update all relevant public-facing docs in this repository so behavior is accurate, explicit, and auditable.

⸻

🎯 Your task

Update documentation files only.
Do not change runtime behavior, database schema, or APIs.

⸻

📂 Files to update
	1.	README.md
	•	Add a section:

## Protocol Version Handling


	•	Explain:
	•	protocolVersion is optional but recommended
	•	Missing → canonical default
	•	Invalid → hard failure
	•	Include example curl with and without protocolVersion
	•	Mention headers:
	•	X-Protocol-Version
	•	X-Protocol-Defaulted

	2.	docs/ or docs/protocol.md (if present)
	•	Add subsection:

### Protocol Version Resolution


	•	Clearly describe:
	•	Explicit version pinning
	•	Defaulted resolution
	•	Audit visibility
	•	Include a short truth table

	3.	CLI documentation (README or /docs/cli.md)
	•	State explicitly:
	•	CLI always injects protocolVersion
	•	CLI users never rely on defaulting
	•	Add note:
“Defaulting exists for API and integration safety, not CLI usage.”
	4.	Examples
	•	Ensure at least one example includes protocolVersion
	•	If any example omits it, add a comment explaining defaulting
	5.	Changelog or release notes (if present)
	•	Add entry:

Added: Lenient protocolVersion defaulting with explicit audit marking



⸻

🧠 Language & constraints
	•	Use precise, technical language
	•	Avoid words like “fallback” or “silent”
	•	Emphasize:
	•	determinism
	•	auditability
	•	explicit resolution
	•	Do NOT remove strict validation for invalid versions

⸻

📌 Required sentence (include verbatim)

“If protocolVersion is omitted, the renderer resolves it to the current canonical protocol version and records that resolution as part of the execution proof.”

⸻

✅ Acceptance criteria
	•	Docs match current runtime behavior exactly
	•	Defaulting behavior is discoverable and unambiguous
	•	CLI behavior is clearly differentiated from API behavior
	•	No contradictions across files

⸻

🚫 Do not
	•	Change code
	•	Add new features
	•	Rename headers
	•	Reword protocol semantics

⸻

If you want, next I can give you:
	•	A second Replit prompt to add a tiny /version and /api/render doc test block
	•	Or a pre-launch doc audit checklist (what an enterprise reviewer will look for)
	•	Or a one-page spec excerpt you can link from the README

You’re extremely close to “this feels inevitable” territory.

Here’s exactly what to tell Replit — short, precise, and framed so it doesn’t trigger another redesign.

You can copy-paste this.

Message to Replit (canonical renderer node)

Context

We are building a server-side canonical execution node for the NexArt protocol.

This node is not a frontend app and not a preview renderer.

Its sole purpose is to act as the authoritative, deterministic execution environment for NexArt Code Mode, using the SDK below as the single source of truth:

@nexart/codemode-sdk — Canonical Code Mode Authority

Whatever this SDK does is the NexArt protocol.

⸻

What this node must do (no more, no less)
	1.	Accept a protocol-compliant MintSnapshotV1
	•	Must include code (string), seed, vars[10], execution mode
	2.	Execute the artwork via @nexart/codemode-sdk
	•	No custom drawing logic
	•	No reimplementation of p5 helpers
	3.	Enforce protocol invariants:
	•	Canvas hard-locked to 1950×2400
	•	Deterministic execution (same input → same output)
	4.	Produce authoritative output:
	•	PNG bytes
	•	SHA-256 hash of the PNG
	5.	Return a canonical result envelope, e.g.:

{
  "mime": "image/png",
  "imageHash": "<sha256>",
  "imageBase64": "<png-bytes>"
}

This response is the ground truth for minting and verification.

⸻

Important constraints
	•	Do NOT redesign the protocol
	•	Do NOT introduce alternative execution paths
	•	Do NOT attempt to “fix” user code (fail hard instead)
	•	Do NOT diverge from @nexart/codemode-sdk semantics

This node is an attestation service, not a convenience renderer.

⸻

Goal

Once the node is correct in Replit (dev), it will be deployed unchanged to Railway and made public as the official NexArt Canonical Renderer.

⸻

Why this wording matters

This tells Replit, very explicitly:
	•	❌ no product thinking
	•	❌ no abstractions
	•	❌ no “better architecture”
	•	✅ strict protocol executor
	•	✅ SDK = law
	•	✅ determinism > flexibility

It aligns them with how you’re thinking about NexArt as a protocol, not an app.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Rewrite this as a README.md for the node repo
	•	Help you define a versioned API contract (v1 locked)
	•	Or prepare the public announcement text for when the node goes live

Just say the word.

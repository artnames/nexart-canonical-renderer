You are Replit AI. Act as a senior Node/TypeScript engineer + documentation-focused maintainer.

Repo to work on
- The separate public Node backend repo (the “node” repo) for NexArt.
- This repo runs the NexArt CodeMode SDK directly (as a dependency), not a fork. Your job is to make that fact explicit and auditable.

Task: Implement ITEM 3 ONLY
ITEM 3 = Update Node documentation + version clarity so it’s clear, reproducible, and enterprise-auditable.
Do NOT implement reliability/backups (that is item 4).
Do NOT implement CLI or SDK changes (that is items 0–2).
You may add tiny helper code ONLY if required to expose version info cleanly.

Hard rules
- Do not change protocol semantics.
- Do not introduce breaking API changes unless unavoidable.
- No telemetry.
- Keep the node repo open-source; monetization is via hosted deployment (API keys/quotas) later.

========================
ITEM 3 DELIVERABLES
========================

A) Documentation: Make the Node repo purpose crystal clear
1) Update README.md with these sections (keep it crisp):
   - What this server is:
     * Hosted verification / attestation / replay services built on NexArt CodeMode SDK
   - What this server is NOT:
     * Not required for local deterministic execution
     * Not a replacement for the SDK/CLI
   - Core vs Edges:
     * SDK + CLI = free core
     * Node-hosted service = paid edge when operated by NexArt (accounts/quotas/SLAs)
     * Anyone can self-host, but “NexArt Attested” refers to NexArt-hosted signature
   - Quickstart (dev):
     * How to install deps, set env vars, run locally
   - Versioning & Reproducibility (IMPORTANT):
     * How the server pins @nexart/codemode-sdk
     * How to determine which SDK/protocol/runtime version verified a result
     * Commitment: the server returns explicit version info for each verification/attestation

2) Add docs/architecture.md (or docs/core-vs-edges.md in this repo) with:
   - Diagram-like explanation:
     * SDK/CLI local flow
     * Node hosted edge flow
   - What is signed, what is verified
   - Definitions:
     * “NexArt Attested” vs “Self Attested”

B) Version clarity: Pin and expose SDK/protocol/runtime versions
1) Inspect how the repo currently depends on @nexart/codemode-sdk:
   - package.json dependency range (^, ~, exact, git hash)
   - If it’s a loose range (like ^1.x), change it to an EXACT pin:
     "@nexart/codemode-sdk": "X.Y.Z"
   - If it uses a git ref, ensure it is pinned to a specific commit.
   - Document the choice in README.

2) Add a small module to expose version data:
   - Create `src/version.ts` (or similar) that exports:
     - sdkVersion (from package.json dependency or from the SDK if it exposes version)
     - protocolVersion (from the SDK constant if available, otherwise from a config/env value)
     - runtimeHash or buildId (if available; otherwise set to the node build git SHA via env var like GIT_SHA)
   - If the SDK exports protocol version/runtime hash, use those. Do not invent.

3) Add a new endpoint (or extend an existing one) to make version visibility explicit:
   - GET /version
     returns:
     {
       service: "nexart-node",
       sdkVersion,
       protocolVersion,
       runtimeHash,
       serviceBuild: GIT_SHA (if available)
     }

4) Ensure any existing verification/attestation endpoint responses include version fields:
   - For each response that claims “verified/attested”, include:
     - sdkVersion
     - protocolVersion
     - runtimeHash/serviceBuild
   - If endpoints don’t exist yet, just implement /version and update docs (do not create new product endpoints).

C) Reproducibility notes for users
In README, add a short “Reproduce locally” section that states:
- If you have a snapshot created by the CLI, you can replay/verify offline.
- Node server is optional; it provides hosted third-party trust when run by NexArt.

========================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
========================
1) Start by printing:
   - repo tree
   - current package.json dependencies (focus on @nexart/codemode-sdk)
   - current README license/version claims
2) Provide a short plan (bullets).
3) Apply changes:
   - README updates
   - add docs file(s)
   - pin dependency (if needed)
   - add /version endpoint + version module
4) Provide exact commands to run locally and test /version.

Proceed now. Do not ask questions unless truly blocked; make reasonable assumptions and implement item 3 only.
